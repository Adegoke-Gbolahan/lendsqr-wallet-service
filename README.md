# Lendsqr Wallet Service

This project provides a wallet management service that supports user registration, wallet funding, withdrawals, and transfers between users. The service is built using **Node.js** with **Express** for API handling, **Knex.js** for database management, and **JWT-based authentication** for security.

## API Endpoints

### **Authentication**
- **POST** `/api/login`  
  Login a user and return a JWT token.

- **POST** `/api/register-user`  
  Register a new user.

### **Wallet Operations**
- **POST** `/api/fund-wallet`  
  Fund a user’s wallet.  
  **Auth**: Bearer Token required.

  **Request Body:**
  ```json
  { "userId": 8, "amount": 1000 }
  ```

- **POST** `/api/withdraw`  
  Withdraw funds from the user’s wallet.

- **POST** `/api/fund-transfer`  
  Transfer funds between two users.

  **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "senderId": 8,
    "recipientId": 10,
    "amount":50
}
  ```

---

## Authentication

This project uses **JWT-based authentication**. Every protected endpoint expects a valid token in the `Authorization` header.

### Example:
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
}
```

Use the `/login` endpoint to generate tokens during development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- Knex.js installed globally (optional for managing migrations)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adegoke-Gbolahan/lendsqr-wallet-service.git
   cd lendsqr-wallet-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/lendsqr_wallet
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   npx knex migrate:latest
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** and **Supertest** for automated testing.  
To run tests, execute:
```bash
npm test
```

### Sample Test (Wallet API):
```typescript
import request from 'supertest';
import app from '../app';

describe('Wallet API', () => {
  it('should fund wallet successfully', async () => {
    const token = 'your-jwt-token'; // Replace with a valid token

    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/fund-wallet')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .send({ userId: 8, amount: 1000 });

    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(res.body.message).toBe('Wallet funded successfully');
  });
});
```

## Design Decisions

1. **JWT Authentication**: Chosen for simplicity and stateless authentication.
1. **NIN Verification**: Ensure user are legit and correct details is provided.
2. **Knex.js for Database Management**: Provides flexibility and SQL dialect support for different databases.
3. **User Activity Logging**: Helps track important user actions (login, fund, transfer, etc.) for auditing purposes.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers handle business logic, models manage database operations, and middleware provides authentication.
5. **Password Strength Enforcement**: Use libraries like `zxcvbn` to validate password strength during registration.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of sensitive endpoints.
2. **Email Notifications**: Send emails on key actions such as wallet funding or withdrawals.
3. **Swagger Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation using Swagger for easy integration by frontend teams.
4. **Transaction History API**: Expose an endpoint to retrieve the user’s transaction history from logs.

## Conclusion

This wallet service project is a robust foundation for managing digital wallets. With essential features like wallet funding, withdrawals, and transfers, along with JWT authentication and user activity tracking, it provides a secure and scalable backend for financial applications.
